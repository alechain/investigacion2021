	abstract = {Why do people leave their homes? This seemingly easy question requires a more complex answer. What ultimately prompts a person to leave if it is impossible to find a job due to a conflict that has destroyed all economic opportunities? Evidence suggests that the migration decision is a complex process that is dependent on a multitude of factors, such as migration governance regimes, migration and smuggler networks, access to technology, or individual characteristics such as age, gender and educational background. I use a theoretical framework to present the variety of determinants that have been put forward as influencing migration decisions at the macro-, meso-, and micro-level. This structured overview discusses their importance for different forms of migration and subsequently helps to identify gaps for further research.},

We first illustrate the activities of immigrants after returning. We show that more than half of the returning migrants are economically active after return, and most of them engage in entrepreneurial activities. We then develop a model, where migrants decide simultaneously about the optimal migration duration, and their after-return activities. Guided by this model, we specify and estimate an empirical model, where the after-return activity, and the optimal migration duration are simultaneously chosen.},

The theory of immigration presented in this paper describes the way in which immigrants are sorted among host countries in terms of both their observed and unobserved characteristics.

	abstract = {In the paper we use a unique new data set which has been collected in late 2006 in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to investigate the determinants for short term migration and its destination and duration patterns. Special attention is paid to the role played by personal networks to Eastern and Western destinations as well as investments into the transferability of human capital made by migrants prior to their stay abroad. We find that many determinants and migration patterns are quite similar across the CIS countries under consideration but exhibit some surprising differences to standard results from the migration literature, e.g. the prevalence of older migrants and the low importance of children in the migration decision process. Networks and human capital transferability are the main explaining factors for the migration and destination decision, a result proofing robust after correcting for endogeneity. We expect that migration is likely to grow in importance for some countries at the European Borderlands, as networks develop and the costs of migration decrease. However, our analysis reveals that fears of brain drain have little substance as the educational background of migrants is rather low. As a considerable number of migrants have invested into destination country specific human capital prior to migration, this improved human capital endowment can benefit both, migrants and the society of sending countries, alike. --},

Empirical results, based on Mexican village data, support the hypothesis that households' relative deprivation in the village reference group is significant in explaining migration by household members to destinations where a reference group substitution is unlikely and the returns to migration are high. Independent of relative deprivation, village households wisely pair their members with the labor markets in which the returns to their human capital are likely to be greatest. The results suggest that a specific type of migration constitutes a response to a specific configuration of variables, and the role of relative deprivation appears to differ for internal and international migration. Taking relative deprivation into account when studying migration is shown to have important implications for development policy. For example, economic development that does not redress intra-village income inequalities may become associated with more migration. Copyright 1991 by Royal Economic Society.},

	abstract = {We investigate determinants of individual migration decisions in Vietnam, a country with increasingly high levels of geographical labor mobility. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) of 2012, we find that probability of migration is strongly associated with individual, household and community-level characteristics. The probability of migration is higher for young people and those with post-secondary education. Migrants are more likely to be from households with better-educated household heads, female-headed households, and households with higher youth dependency ratios. Members of ethnic minority groups are much less likely to migrate, other things equal. Using multinomial logit methods, we distinguish migration by broad destination, and find that those moving to Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi have broadly similar characteristics to those moving to other destinations. We also use VHLSS 2012 together with VHLSS 2010 to identify recent migrants — those present in the household in 2010, but who have moved away by 2012. This yields much tighter results. For education below upper secondary school, the evidence on positive selection by education is much stronger.  However, the ethnic minority “penalty” on spatial labor mobility remains strong and significant. This lack of mobility is a leading candidate to explain the distinctive persistence of poverty among Vietnam’s ethnic minority populations, even as national poverty has sharply diminished.},

Political researchers are often confronted with unordered categorical variables, such as the vote-choice of a particular voter in a multiparty election. In such situations, researchers must choose an appropriate empirical model to analyze this data. The two most commonly used models are the multinomial logit (MNL) model and the multinomial probit (MNP) model. MNL is simpler, but also makes the often erroneous independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption. MNP is computationally intensive, but does not assume IIA, and for this reason many researchers have assumed that MNP is a better model. Little evidence exists, however, which shows that MNP will provide more accurate results than MNL. In this paper, I conduct computer simulations and show that MNL nearly always provides more accurate results than MNP, even when the IIA assumption is severely violated. The results suggest that researchers in the field should reconsider use of MNP as the most reliable empirical model.},

We will begin to learn whether assuming IIA holds poses serious estimation problems for migration modeling.

	abstract = {Economic geography (the study of the location of factors of production in space) plays a small role in economic modeling, but facts of economic modeling are an intuitively striking feature of real-world economies. The paper intends to show how models and techniques derived from theoretical industrial organization allow a reconsideration of the insights possible from economic geography. To show the application, the paper considers one of the key questions -- why and when manufacturing is concentrated in a few regions.         To realize economies of scale while minimizing transportation costs,         manufacturing firms tend to locate in regions with larger demand, but location of demand depends on the distribution of manufacturing. The externalities that lead to emergence of the core-periphery pattern are pecuniary (due to supply or demand) rather than primarily technological spillovers. Concentration of manufacturing need not always happen and may depend on a few key parameters.  Once population starts to concentrate and regions to diverge, the process will feed upon itself.                 A model of geographical concentration of manufacturing, based on the interaction of economies of scale with transportation costs, is developed to explain how countries endogenously become differentiated into an industrialized core and agricultural periphery. The model has two regions, and two kinds of production, manufacturing and agriculture, in each region. Also considered in the model are transportation costs, firm behavior, economies of scale, and conditions for manufacturing concentration. The concepts of short-run and full equilibrium are also introduced.                 The model shows that in an economy with high transportation costs, a small portion of footloose manufacturing, or weak economies of scale, the distribution of the primary strata of peasants will determine the distribution of manufacturing production. When opposite conditions prevail, circular causation sets in, and manufacturing concentrates in the region that gets a head start.  (TNM)},

	abstract = {En este trabajo se emplea la metodología del análisis de factores para construir indicadores sintéticos que permiten caracterizar la situación económica-social de las provincias argentinas. Partiendo de dieciséis variables se construyen tres indicadores sintéticos: económico-social; de mercado laboral; y de tasa de desempleo. Los resultados muestran el siguiente ordenamiento de las provincias argentinas según su ubicación en el ranking económico-social: 1) Ciudad de Buenos Aires; 2) Santa Cruz; 3) Chubut; 4) La Pampa; 5) Tierra del Fuego; 6) Neuquén; 7) Buenos Aires; 8) Santa Fe; 9) Córdoba; 10) Río Negro; 11) Mendoza; 12) Entre Ríos; 13) San Luis; 14) Catamarca; 15) San Juan; 16) Tucumán; 17) La Rioja; 18) Salta; 19) Jujuy; 20) Misiones; 21)Corrientes; 22) Santiago del Estero; 23) Chaco; y 24) Formosa. Una ubicación menor (mayor) indica un mejor (peor) desempeño económico-social. Se analiza la evolución temporal de la situación relativa de las provincias argentinas mediante la comparación de los resultados obtenidos con los del trabajo de Nuñez Miñana (1972). Se evalúa también la hipótesis de convergencia económico-social de las provincias argentinas.},

The book first introduces readers to basic techniques, a rich variety of models, and underlying theory that is easy to put into practice. It then presents readers with a sufficient theoretical background to understand advanced techniques and to recognize new variants of established models. This focus, along with hundreds of worked numerical examples, ensures that readers can apply the theory to real-world application and are prepared to be successful economists in the field.},

	abstract = {We investigate determinants of individual migration decisions in Vietnam, a country with increasingly high levels of geographical labor mobility. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) of 2012, we find that probability of migration is strongly associated with individual, household and community-level characteristics. The probability of migration is higher for young people and those with post-secondary education. Migrants are more likely to be from households with better-educated household heads, female-headed households, and households with higher youth dependency ratios. Members of ethnic minority groups are much less likely to migrate, other things equal. Using multinomial logit methods, we distinguish migration by broad destination, and find that those moving to Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi have broadly similar characteristics to those moving to other destinations. We also use VHLSS 2012 together with VHLSS 2010 to identify recent migrants — those present in the household in 2010, but who have moved away by 2012. This yields much tighter results. For education below upper secondary school, the evidence on positive selection by education is much stronger.  However, the ethnic minority “penalty” on spatial labor mobility remains strong and significant. This lack of mobility is a leading candidate to explain the distinctive persistence of poverty among Vietnam’s ethnic minority populations, even as national poverty has sharply diminished.},
